## PART I
### Supervised classification, overfitting and inductive biases in convnets, and how to improve models through self-supervision

* Exercise 1: Implement and train a Resnet-50 classifier using supervised learning; enable/disable batch norm updates to see the effect.
* Exercise 2: Inductive biases in convnets; comparison with MLP.
* Exercise 3: Overfitting and regularization using weight decay.
* Exercise 4: Enable self-supervised learning using data augmentation.
