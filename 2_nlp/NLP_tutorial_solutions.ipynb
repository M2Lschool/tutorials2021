    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we want the network to generate multiple predictions conditioned only on a few initial values. To do so, we will predict the next value of the function in a loop, conditioning on the value at the previous time-step (be it the initial, given, values or the ones predicted by the network at each previous step).\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn the prediction model, we will use **teacher forcing**. This means that *during training* we will condition the model on values *coming from the ground truth* (i.e., the real sequence), rather than the output produced by the model at $t-1$. This makes training easier, because errors do not compound (a bad prediction at time $t$ does not influence the next prediction at time $t+1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "At *inference time* (i.e., when we want to generate data from the model) we do not have access to the true sequence, so we must condition on the values *predicted by the model in previous time-steps*. This often leads to some compounding error, which generally makes it harder and harder to generate long sequences accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "To alleviate this problem we will also experiment with **warm starting**, which amounts to feeding the model with values coming from the ground truth (as done when teacher forcing) *only for a few initial steps*, and then feed it with its previous predictions instead. The rationale for this is to make training easier initially, to help the model learn the true function, and then feed it with its predictions to become robust to imperfect data."

    "\n",
    "- Teacher forcing makes BPTT much easier and works better in practice. Intuition is similar to imitation learning. Without teacher forcing it is very hard to learn because error tend to accumulate. But using teacher forcing you get very local structure, meaning that the model is less able to generalize and is less robust to small perturbations (i.e., errors) of the input.\n",
    "- No teacher forcing makes training very difficult.\n",
    "- Depending on what you want to model, this loss may be fine if you care about probabilities but not generating samples.\n",
    "- Warm starting simplifies the task at the beginning of training, which makes the optimization easier, but (different from teacher forcing) eventually reintroduces the full task by conditioning on previous predictions. The learned model is thus more robust to noise in its input, which reduces compounding errors and improves the quality of sampled predictions.\n",
    "- The model learns to predict sequences of length unroll_length and at sampling time is required to generalize to longer sequences. When used to sample much longer predictions than the unroll length, their accuracy degrades."

Intuitively the idea is that, depending on the topic discussed in a document or a set of documents, specific words will appear more or less frequently. For instance, 'dog' and 'bone' will appear more often in documents about dogs, while 'cat' and 'meow' will appear in documents about cats. Common words, like 'the' and 'is', will tend to appear approximately uniformely in all kinds of documents so are not very informative to tell the documents apart. We can exploit this to cluster the documents in groups, according to their topic.\n",

This means that sentences can be transformed into a dense and meaningful representation exploiting these large pretrained language models.\n",

One thing you can do is: restart the notebook, generate the embeddings, and then train this new network with jax. You can look at jax memory allocation settings [here](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gpu_memory_allocation.html)."
