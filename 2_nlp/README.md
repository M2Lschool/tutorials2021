**Authors**: **[Federico Bianchi](https://federicobianchi.io)**, **[Debora Nozza](https://dnozza.github.io/)** and **[Francesco Visin](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=kaAnZw0AAAAJ)**

**Description**:

In this tutorial, you will learn the fundamental components and main tasks in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain.

The tutorial is structured as follows:

* Imports and downloads (shared across sections)
* Part I: *Inner mechanisms of a vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)*
* Part II: *Character-level language modeling with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks*
* Part III: *Non-negative Matrix Factorization for topic modeling*
* Part IV: *From traditional (bag-of-words) to pretrained representations (BERT) for text classification*


All sections can be executed independently after running the initial import and download cells.

The section marked as \[EXERCISE\] contain cells with missing code that you should complete.
